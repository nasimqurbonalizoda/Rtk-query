# React + Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) Todo App

It supports:

1. **GET** – fetch all todos/categories  
2. **POST** – add a new todo/category (with FormData for images)  
3. **PUT** – edit a todo/category  
4. **DELETE** – delete a todo/category  
5. **DELETE IMAGE** – delete a specific image  
6. **ADD IMAGE** – add images via FormData  
7. **Checkbox toggle** – update completion status
